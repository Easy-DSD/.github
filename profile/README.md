## üöÄ Overview

**Easy DSD** is a macOS audio utility built for audiophiles who want to convert, process, and enjoy **Direct Stream Digital (DSD)** audio files with uncompromising quality. DSD is a high-resolution audio format used in SACDs and professional studios, offering exceptional depth and clarity. However, handling DSD can be tricky without the right tools. Easy DSD solves this by providing a clean, efficient interface for converting, playing, and managing DSD audio.  

With Easy DSD, you can convert **DSD to PCM (FLAC, WAV, AIFF, ALAC, etc.)** and vice versa, maintaining high-fidelity output. The app is optimized for macOS and supports hardware acceleration when available, ensuring faster conversion speeds without compromising audio quality. It‚Äôs designed for both casual listeners who simply want their DSD files in playable formats, and professional users who need to integrate high-resolution audio into their workflow.  

Batch conversion, customizable sample rates, bit depths, and metadata preservation are all included. For playback, Easy DSD integrates with macOS audio drivers and external DACs, giving you the option to enjoy native DSD playback if your hardware supports it. This makes it not just a converter, but also a reliable companion for high-end audio enjoyment.
